### First Encounters in Shanghai
Back on a sweltering June morning in 2017, Sophie and Ryan first met at a 6 am fitness group in Shanghai, China. After losing touch for another two months, they stumbled upon one another at a falafel shop. From that moment forward, they became friends.

### Similar Ideals
While hanging out for a while, they realized they shared similar values and interests in everything; from yoga to environmental protection to having a crazy night out and more.

### Move to Berlin and the birth of Sophie and Ryan
Strangely enough, they both ended up in Berlin, Germany for different reasons in 2019. After being fed up with the world and how we treat it as humans, Sophie and Ryan created...well [Sophie and Ryan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsUwAnF0RDWSHhHnmkcAuyw?view_as=subscriber) as a means to becoming better people.

### Enjoy, you gorgeously sexy beast, you!
