  me to put myself back in the shoes of myself on an exceedingly anxious day.
  For that, I have journal entries. Here is one from April 1st:

> I am feeling super anxious this morning. I hate when it starts to get hard to get out of bed, that is when I know it is getting more serious. I need to chill out though, seriously, it just isn't worth it to put in this much effort. It should be easier. 

That was me just three days ago. Now that I have reread this, I am able to empathize slightly more with that other person. I remember waking up about 7:30 and not being able to pull myself out until an hour later. I remember lashing out at my partner during what was meant to be a reinvigorating work out.
