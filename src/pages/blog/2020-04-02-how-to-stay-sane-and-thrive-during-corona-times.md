### Meditation

Research shows that meditation reduces stress, controls anxiety, increases self awareness, and promotes emotional health to name a few. There are so many ways to meditate for instance silent meditation where you focus on the breath, guided meditations with apps like headspace, or you can just search for specific meditations that resonate with you on YouTube. [Here’s an absolute gem of a meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lssNBHXz4Vw).

### Talk to a friend on Skype or Zoom!

Even though Ryan and I aren’t seeing each other we still make time to call each other and we’ve been doing that with other friends, too. It helps you to feel connected during this isolation time. Amen to technology.

### Drink tea

It’s just seriously relaxing and enjoyable. Teas like chamomile and peppermint particularly are known for their calming benefits. So next time you’re feeling overwhelmed, keep calm and have a cuppa.

### Learn a new skill

This can be big or small. During this time we’re focusing on improving our German skills. Sehr gut.

### Read a book

Join our book club where once a month we pick a new book to review. Our last book was You Are A Badass by Jen Sincero. You can grab a copy of it on amazon [here](https://amzn.to/2V4ta5b). Or join our next bookclub where we will be talking about SEX. Get a copy of [the Multiorgasmic Man](https://amzn.to/3276VNF) or [the Multiorgasmic Woman](https://amzn.to/3276VNF) and join!

### Journal

It’s so beneficial to get your thoughts down on paper everyday. Put aside 5 minutes in the morning before or after a cheeky meditation to structure your thoughts, day, and game plans.

### Be kind to others

Practice compassion to uplift yourself and others. If you need pointers check out the Jar Project, our latest project, where we challenge you to do random acts of kindness by simply clicking [on our digital jar](https://itssophieandryan.com/blog/2020-03-29-bring-on-april-and-the-jar-project/).

### Yoga

The health and mental benefits of yoga are endless. Here are a few of our favourite yoga channels available for free on YouTube.

### Get organised

This is a great time to declutter your house or apartment. By having a clean, organised space, you’re more likely to be productive.

### Get dressed

Getting ready for the day will help bring some structure to your day and program your brain to get into work mode. Whilst slouching around in your pjs all day, you know, just cause, might be irresistible at times, you’re far less likely to achieve as much, so make it a point to put your pants on.

### Get moving

Commit yourself to daily exercise for both your mind and body. It’s super important to keep fit and healthy during this time as it boosts your immune system. There are so many workouts available on YouTube right now the possibilities are endless.

### Start a home project

If you’re stuck for things to do get your hands stuck into home improvements! Whether it’s painting your bedroom or ordering some new plants, make it your mission to emerge from the lockdown with an upgraded pad.

### Do absolutely nothing

Netflix and chill has never been more legit. In moderation this is a great way to destress and take your mind off of things.

## And don’t forget Wash your hands. FREQUENTLY.
