As we know, 2020 has been an absolute shit show, but that isnâ€™t necessarily a bad thing. I mean if you are a believer in [Chaos Theory](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/02/13/chaos-theory-the-butterfly-effect-and-the-computer-glitch-that-started-it-all/#20af5e3c69f6) like me, our universe is supposed be erratic, unpredictable, exciting; that is just how it is supposed to work, and any suppression of this is unnatural. ***Crisis is a catalyst for change.***

Social isolation and distancing during the Covid-19 time appears to separate us; tear us apart socially at the seams. But during this time, the need to be generous and kind to others is as important as ever.

### Introducing The Jar Project

##### Every day starting April 1st, head over to [The Jar Project](https://www.thejarproject.com) and pick a task out of the jar. Each task is an act of kindness that can be done over the phone or online. Feel free to add your own tasks to the jar too.

#### Share it, post it, and infect others with generosity (not Corona) #thejarproject
